## JavaScript Object Notation

- it is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate.
- It is often used for transmitting data between a server and a web application, as well as for storing and exchanging data in a variety of other contexts

- The syntax of a JSON file is based on a collection of key-value pairs, with each key and its corresponding value separated by a colon, and each pair separated by a comma. The entire collection is wrapped in curly braces {} to indicate that it is an object. Here is an example of a simple JSON object:

```JSON
{
  "name": "Shubh",
  "age": 23,
  "city": "Bareilly"
}

```

In this above example, "name", "age", and "city" are the keys, and "Shubh", 23, and "Bareilly" are their corresponding values.

Note: In JSON files, string values are enclosed in double quotes, while numeric values and boolean values are not.

- JSON can also represent arrays, which are collections of values separated by commas and wrapped in square brackets []. Here is an example of a JSON array:

```JSON
[  "apple",  "banana",  "cherry"]
```

- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is similar to XML (eXtensible Markup Language) and YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) in that they are all data interchange formats used to represent and transmit structured data between applications and systems. Like XML and YAML, JSON uses a hierarchical structure to represent data, with data organized into a tree-like structure of key-value pairs. However, there are some differences in syntax and usage between the three formats.
