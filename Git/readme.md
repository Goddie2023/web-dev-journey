> Funfact: GitHub has 100+ million users now.

**Linus Torvalds is the person who created Git and Linux Kernel**

## Why use Git? 

- Fast
- Keeps track of changes
- Easy to use
- Non-linear
- Distributed
- Large

# What is a Commit?

- In Git, a commit is a **snapshot** of the changes made to a repository at a particular point in time.
- It represents a set of changes made to the codebase, such as adding or modifying files, or making changes to existing files.
- Each commit has a **unique identifier**, called a hash, that allows you to refer to it and track the changes made to the code over time.
- When you create a commit, you also add a **commit message** that describes the changes you've made.

**A meme**

> This meme is famous because developers need to commit their changes so that the history of the code remains on the central repo (GitHub)


## What is a Branch?

- Git branches are like those smaller branches on a tree.
- They're separate paths of development that come from the main branch.
- Each branch can have its own set of changes and updates.
- The changes that you made on a branch will not affect the `main` branch.

## What is a Pull Request?

- If someone else wants to make a change in your code they can do that and can ask you if you want to pull these changes into your code.
- To do that they can create a separate branch of or a fork of the code.
- These changes then can be merged into the main branch using a **PR or a pull request.**
- A pull request is a report of all the changes made.
- Once that branch is merged into main, you can also delete that branch.

## What is a fork?

- A Fork is a way to create a copy of a repository (a project) that belongs to someone else. 
- When you fork a repository, you're essentially making a duplicate of the project and creating your own version of it.
- Changes made in your forked repository won't affect the original project or anyone else's fork of it.
