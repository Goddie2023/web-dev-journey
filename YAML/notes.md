## YAML aint Markup language

- A YAML file is a plain text file format used for data serialization. It stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language." Unlike other data serialization formats 
like XML and JSON, YAML is designed to be human-readable and easy to write, making it popular for configuration files and other types of data interchange.

- YAML's syntax is based on indentation and key-value pairs. Key-value pairs are expressed as "key: value" and are separated by a colon. 
Lists are represented with a hyphen followed by a space and then the list item. Here's an example of a simple YAML file:

```YAML
name: John Doe
age: 35
hobbies:
  - reading
  - hiking
  - cooking
```
- YAML doesn't have too much of syntax like json and xml, As you can see here:

- YAML is used for a variety of purposes, including configuration files for applications, data exchange between different programming languages, 
and for defining workflows in tools like Github Actions, Ansible, Kubernetes etc.

## Why is YAML Preferred over JSON?

1. Readability: YAML syntax is easier to read and write than JSON syntax. 
YAML uses indentation and whitespace to structure data, which makes it more human-readable and easier to understand.
2. YAML supports more data types than JSON, such as dates, timestamps, and multiline strings. 
It also supports comments, which can make it easier to document configuration files.
3. YAML can be easily integrated with programming languages, like Python, Ruby, and Java, which makes it an attractive choice for data serialization in these languages.
4. Good for defining workflows in different Devops tools.
