## Truthy and falsy values

These are not a different datatype but just some values that are not strictly true/false but 
still act like true and false values.

- Falsy values -> false, 0, -0, BigInt 0n, Null, undefined, Nan, ""
- Truthy values -> anything other than falsy values is considered true.
