## Datatypes

- JS can work with String, Numbers, Boolean, null, undefined, symbols. These are called **Primitive Data Types**.
- JS also consists of non-primitive datatypes such as arrays, objects, queues, etc.
- Numbers can be of types floats and integers both signed and unsigned.
- To check datatype of any data, use `typeof` operator.
    - `for ex: const age = 10; console.log(typeof age);`
> **Note:** ðŸ”´ If you output the `typeof` of null it will show **object** which is totally wrong and should be ignored. Null is a null type of datatype and not object.
