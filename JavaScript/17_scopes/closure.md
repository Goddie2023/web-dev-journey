## Closure

- Outer function can not access inner functionâ€™s data but inner function can do that even after outer function has stopped execution.
- A closure allows the inner function to "close over" and access the variables of its outer function.

### Example

![closure](https://github.com/shubhsharma19/web-development-journey/assets/69891912/cb830186-3b09-4b75-a316-6e8acb9102b7)
