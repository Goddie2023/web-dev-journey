## Higher order functions

A higher-order function (HOF) is a function that treats other functions as values. Basically a function that **takes a function as arguments** or **returns a function**.

It can do at least one of the following:

1. **Take one or more functions as arguments:** This means you can pass a function to a HOF, just like you would pass a number or string.

2. **Return a function as its result:** This means a HOF can create and return a new function, which can then be used elsewhere in your code.

Some common examples of HOF: 
- map()
- forEach()
- filter()
- reduce()

These above methods takes callback functions.
