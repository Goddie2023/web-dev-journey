HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas. 
These elements make your HTML easier to read and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility. 
`<main>`

You can add images to your website by using the `img` element. 
`img` element have an opening tag without a closing tag. 
**self-closing tags** are the tags that do not need a closing tag. 
`<img>`

HTML _attributes_ are special words used inside the opening tag of an element to control the element's behavior. 
The `src` attribute in an `img` tag specifies the image's URL (where the image is located).
`<img src = “imagelink”>`

All `img` elements should have an `alt` attribute. 
The `alt` attribute's text is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load. 
For example,

`<img src="cat.jpg" alt="A Small cat">` has an `alt` attribute with the text `A Small cat`

To link page to another page with the anchor can be done using anchor element. For example, 
`<a href=""> textgoeshere </a>`
